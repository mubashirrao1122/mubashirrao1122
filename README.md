### Hi, I’m Mubashir 👋

CS senior at FAST (Pakistan), currently focusing on **Bitcoin open-source development**.

**Current focus**
- Contributing to Bitcoin / Lightning Network repositories  
- Systems programming (Rust, reading C++)  
- Testing, tooling, and small correctness-focused improvements  

**Why Bitcoin OSS**
I’m interested in long-lived, safety-critical software and the review-driven culture around Bitcoin development.

**2026 goals**
- Contribute consistently to Bitcoin-adjacent open-source projects  
- Apply to Summer of Bitcoin 2026  
- Grow into a systems / infrastructure engineer

GitHub is my primary workspace contributions and discussions are the best way to see what I’m working on.
